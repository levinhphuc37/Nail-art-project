                            <div class="detail-pera">
                                <p>The history of nail art dates back to as early as 3000 B.C. when the ancient Egyptians were known for decorating their nails with henna. Not only did they adorn their hands and feet, but would also add designs and pictures of nature such as flowers, animals, and plants. It's fair to say that things have moved on somewhat in the last 5,000 years or so. But the principles remain the same. People want to adorn their bodies and make their nails more vibrant and colourful. In this piece, we'll explore the history of nail art from the ancient world to the modern-day world of acrylics and gel polish.</p>
                                <p class="pera-two">For centuries, the ancient Egyptians have cherished henna as more than just a beautiful decoration. Considered to be a powerful natural supplement, they believed that it could help stimulate healthy hair and nail growth in addition to its many medicinal benefits. Its vibrant colours quickly became popular among dancers and royalty who used it to adorn their hands with elaborate designs for long-lasting elegance. The use of henna also spread to the Middle East and India, where it remains popular to this day.</p>
                                <p>Meanwhile, in China, the growing (and painting) of nails were considered to be a symbol of wealth and status. As many of us will know if nails are too long manual tasks can become more tricky to perform. So the wealthy class would keep their nails shorter and paint their vivid colours to show off their status.
                                    With the invention of nail polish in the 16th century, trends quickly evolved to include not just colour but ornate patterns as well. In France during this period, women would often add elaborate designs featuring swirls and other abstract shapes to their nails, while in 19th-century Britain they went for more subtle designs, often preferring to use plain colours such as pinks and yellows.</p>

                            <div class="detail-pera">
                                <p>The Chinese are often credited with creating the first “nail polish”, in 3,000 BC. Women soaked their nails in a combination of egg whites, gelatine, beeswax and dyes from flower petals; roses and orchids were the most popular. The result was shiny nails tinted reddish pink. Long, coloured talons – usually worn with highly decorative nail guards created with hammered brass sheets inlaid with semi-precious stones – were an indication of wealth and social status. The assumption was that you could not possibly have such nails if you were of a lower class. Field work and 15cm talons do not coexist well.</p>
                                <p class="pera-two">The social significance of red nails has been a constant through the ages. They have been reserved for the elite, highlighting nail beds and social inequalities. Members of the Ming dynasty sported crimson nails with lengthy extensions, while the Egyptian queens Nefertiti and Cleopatra were famed for wearing red nails: lower-ranking citizens were forbidden from wearing anything but pale shades. That is striking now, considering how much understated hues – with the notable example of the classic French manicure, which was created in 1975 by the American Jeff Pink, the president of Orly Nails – have been associated with the elite social circles of Wasps and Chelsea-ites. (That said, the style later became popular with the Essex set and once again frowned upon.)</p>
                                <p>What the French – specifically the makeup artist Michelle Menard – can be credited with, however, is introducing a glossy nail polish in the 20s using car paint, although it was available only to a limited few. That changed in 1932 when Revlon launched what we now know as nail polish and opened this aspect of manicuring to the masses. The popularity of nail colour continued for decades, even in times of economic instability, when it was considered an affordable and justifiable luxury. Some shades, such as Chanel’s Rouge Noir, became famous. In 1995, this dried-blood hue, popularised by Uma Thurman’s character in Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction, sold out on the first day it launched. The hype created a 12-month waiting list; it is still Chanel’s bestselling product.</p>

                                <p>The ritual of having one’s nails painted by a professional was largely the preserve of the wealthy until the rise of the nail bar. Thea Green, the founder of Nails Inc, was instrumental in bringing nail bars to the UK. “My lightbulb moment came on a work trip to New York, where I noticed nail bars offering quick, cheap manicures for busy professionals. I was a 23-year-old fashion editor at Tatler at the time – but I knew there was a gap in the market here, so I went for it,” she told Management Today. She opened her first nail bar in 1999, quickly expanded across the country. More recently, she launched a “clean” nail polish range.</p>
                                <p class="pera-three">While Green was about taking the speedy nail bar to customers with a penchant for a classic manicure, the beauty entrepreneur Sharmadean Reid created a movement for a nail tribe looking for something more avant garde. In 2009, she launched Wah Nails in Dalston, east London. This edgy manicure bar specialised in nail art – an antidote to the safe and well-mannered manicures that were all the rage, and a style that was steeped in black culture and Reid’s passion for hip-hop culture .</p>
                                <p>Nail art, of sorts, was popular in the 30s, when Joan Crawford wore the era’s popular crescent moon style, around the same time that Life magazine ran a piece on monogrammed nails. But it was black women who would be at the helm of nail art’s modern cultural resurgence. They gave it new life, from Donyale Luna, the first woman of colour to appear on the cover of US Vogue, and the singer Glodean White , the wife of the late soul crooner Barry White, to to exemplars in the 80s and 90s such as Coko from SWV and Janet Jackson in the futuristic Busta Rhymes video for What’s it Gonna Be?!, where she sported hoop-pierced acrylic nails.</p>
